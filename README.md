# VVVVVV, but it's made in Pygame
***Originally created by GD Colon.***
Exactly what it sounds like. I'm too lazy to go over all the detail but all the code is commented so hopefully that helps.

If you want to add a new stage to the game, add a new level object to `levels.vvvvvv`, and it will automatically appear in both the main game and the editor (via one of the function keys)

## How do I use cheats?
Now for the fun part.

1. Run this (tutorial below)

2. Open a level

3. Press F3 and follow instructions given

## How do I run this?
1. [Install Python 3](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.0/python-3.11.0.exe)

2. Install Pygame by typing `py -m pip install pygame` in the command prompt. Try changing `py` to `python3` or `python` if it doesn't work.

3. Run `vvvvvv.py` (or `editor.py`) by opening the command prompt in the current folder and typing `py vvvvvv.py`. Or you can just run the batch files, or use an IDE.
